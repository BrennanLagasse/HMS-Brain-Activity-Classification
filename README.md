# HMS-Brain-Activity-Classification

Analysis of HMS data: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/hms-harmful-brain-activity-classification/overview

The dataset is not included in this repo and can be downloaded separately. If this repository is added within the folder containing the data file paths will work as intended. Otherwise, make sure to change the paths for the data for the code to work correctly.

Reformatted data for small sample sizes is included in the github, but the full converted data is well over the file size requirement for GitHub. One workaround is just generating random samples from this larger dataset, which will be uploaded later.
